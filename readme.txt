This is my first jms+spring based examples on how to listen to and send to a JMS destination (in this case it's a queue).

Pre-requisites:
1. Activemq installed on your machine and create a queue named "sample.queue"

Run:
	MainJmsLauncher.java, you will see the message on console from that queue.
End
